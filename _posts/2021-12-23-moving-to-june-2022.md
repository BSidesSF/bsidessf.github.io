Following RSA Conference's [announcement](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/press-release/rsa-conference-2022-moves-to-june), the organizers of BSidesSF have decided to move our 2022 event to align with RSAC's new dates in June. Our updated 2022 dates therefore will be **June 4-5, 2022** still held at City View of Metreon in downtown San Francisco, CA.

Our goal continues to be bookending RSAC (holding our event the weekend before), as we appreciate the overlap in participants this affords us. Additionally, with the rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant, we feel not hosting an in-person event during this tumultuous time is in the best interest of our community.

We understand this is a sudden disruption, especially with the conference so close at hand. The pandemic has unfortunately caused a lot of unpredictability with hosting in-person events.

We are actively working to notify all participants, presenters, sponsors, volunteers, and vendors regarding the postponement and will be updating our websites and social media outlets as soon as information is available.

We hope you will still be able to join us in June.

Best,

The BSidesSF Staff
