# Come help us plan the next BSidesSF!

We're looking for a Few Good Humans to help us present the Next Big Thing.

BSidesSF is a 100% volunteer-run organization. All roles are volunteer-based with no pay.

### Volunteer Force

[Volunteering](/cfv) is a good way to show your enthusiasm and ability to work with the group, especially if you want
to help with setup, teardown, and different tasks throughout the event. The Volunteer force shows up during the event,
and does not get involved in the months of planning and preparation which happens before the event.
This is great option for those who want to help, yet don't have extra time in their lives. In 2024 we started a program
for those volunteers who were able and willing to take on dedicated roles for at least a full day.
That experiment seems to have worked well and we will likely be expanding it in the future.

### Program Team

The Program team has their own [dedicated application form](https://forms.gle/4BGiKQC1Cdko4cYdA), as the skills for that
team are somewhat specialized. People joining this team help to shape the content of BSidesSF. Responsibilities would include
some combination of reviewing CFP submissions, recommending keynotes, coordinating and coaching speakers, designing and
organizing the schedule, and many other presentation specific roles. CFP reviewers spend roughly 30 or more hours (often way more)
in the Dec/Jan time frame. Other roles in this are have a more substantial engagement, but spread out over the months leading up
to the event.

## Organizers

Beyond these two specific areas, there is a myriad of work needed to make this event successful. This includes lots of nitty
gritty details such as tracking our budget, tracking and delivering all of the materials needed, working with vendors,
managing our social presence, finding sponsors and convincing them to join us, and many other important (one might even say critical)
roles. The time commitment does depend on the role itself, but typically at least a couple hours a week, and often substantial time
in the coupe of months preceding the event. If this sounds like fun to you, [please apply here](https://forms.gle/pFiVwLXdy1gfN64h7).
