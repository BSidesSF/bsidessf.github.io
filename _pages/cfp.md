BSidesSF CFP is Closed! Thanks to all who submitted.

We received a total of 334 reviewable submissions (up 59.8% from 209 in 2023), but could only accept 60. This means we had an unusually low acceptance rate of 17.9% (compared to 28.7% in 2023), despite 45% of the submissions receiving favorable reviews.

We will be reviewing ways to improve the CFP process and acceptance rate for 2025+. Stay tuned!

# **When/Where**

BSidesSF will take place on May 4-5, 2024. The conference will be located at City View at the Metreon in downtown San Francisco.

Note: We **DO NOT** provide speaker or travel stipends at this time (except on a case-by-case basis with villages). We also DO NOT accept vendor pitches of any sort in our conference program. Thank you for your understanding.
