**Hello!**

It's almost time for BSidesSF 2021, our first virtual event, from March 6th to 9th! The theme of this year's event is **Recharge**, and in the spirit of returning and restoring, we've decided to revisit some of the highlights from past events.

To subscribe to future email updates (_highly recommended!_), you can do so [here](/subscribe.html).

**Talks**

Over the course of four days (Saturday through Tuesday), we will be virtually replaying the following talks and pairing the replays with presenter Q&A via Reddit. This is a great opportunity to hear from presenters on new developments since they originally gave their talk.

*   _Checking your --privileged container_ by Maya Kaczorowski and Sam Stewart
*   _Dispatch: Crisis Management Automation When Everything is On Fire_ by Marc Vilanova and Forest Monsen
*   _Give Away Security’s Legos: Dumping Traditional Security Teams_ by Fredrick "Flee" Lee
*   _How to Kill an AWS Access Key_ by Benjamin Hering
*   _How to Orchestrate a Cyber Security Incident Tabletop Exercise_ by Melanie Masterson
*   _How to 10X Your Security (Without the Series D)_ by Clint Gibler
*   _Managing the Assets of your Security Career_ by Kyle Tobener and Chris John Riley
*   _Non-Political Security Learnings from the Mueller Report_ by Arkadiy Tetelman
*   _Offensive Javascript Techniques for Red Teamers (Or Anyone Really)_ by Dylan Ayrey and Christian Frichot
*   _So You’re the First Security Hire_ by Bryan Zimmer
*   _Transform your presentation skills_ by Anne Ricketts and Hilary Spreiter
*   _Visualizing Security_ by Jay Jacobs

**Keynotes**

In the spirit of recharging ourselves, this year's event will also feature two sessions focused on mental health. We will kick off the event with a panel on managing the mental health impact of the pandemic in the workplace. We will hear from experts in mental health, security, and neuroleadership on how to cope in this unprecedentedly stressful time. The NeuroLeadership Institute will also present a session on leadership in the time of a global pandemic. Thanks are due to Netflix for their support and for making these sessions possible!

**Villages · CTF**

In addition to the keynotes and talks, we are also hosting village presentations and a virtual CTF. The [CTF](/ctf.html) will run Saturday through Monday for 50 hours total, with the winners being announced during Tuesday’s sessions. This year's winning CTF team will receive a $1,500 gift card. Second place will receive a $750 gift card and third place a $250 gift card. Thank you to Google for their sponsorship of the CTF!

**Schedule · How to Attend**

We are still finalizing the event schedule, but in the meantime please **mark your calendars for 12:00-4:00pm PST on March 6th and 7th and 12:00-2:00pm PST on March 8th and 9th**. This year's event is completely **free of charge**, as we want this to be an opportunity for everyone to recharge with education, community, and collaboration. The talks will be streamed live to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvWn6Nne_Jj8IkLXZP3tgE6), and you can engage in Q&A on our subreddit [/r/BSidesSF](https://www.reddit.com/r/BSidesSF/). Thank you to our Marquee sponsors -- Adobe, Corelight, Gusto, and Snyk -- for making this event possible! And a special thank you to Apple for their support.

**Thank you!**

Despite the change in event format, we thank you for your continued support in BSidesSF. This will be our first virtual event, and hopefully our last. We hope to be back with a live event in 2022. We look forward to seeing you virtually this year and in-person again next year.

Many thanks,
