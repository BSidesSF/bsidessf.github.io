# CTF is coming back to BSidesSF 2017!

We will be running a CTF this year! Sweet!

The game runs from **Saturday, February 11 at 4pm PST, to Monday, February 13 at 4pm PST**. You can play on-site in the CTF room during the conference, or you can play online by coming back [here](ctf.html).

It'll be targeted towards beginner and intermediate players, but there will be a couple harder challenges as well!

There will be folks on-site in the CTF room and in our [Slack room](https://bsidessf-slack.herokuapp.com) ([#ctf](https://bsidessf.slack.com/messages/ctf/details/)) to answer any questions.

Check back here for more information, or when the game starts!

### E-mail ctf [at] bsidessf.com for questions.
