<p>We want to ensure everybody’s participation is amazing, so please read below for important information concerning this year’s event.</p>

<h3 id="getting-to-the-event">Getting to the Event</h3>

<p>We are back once again at the Metreon located at 135 4th Street in downtown San Francisco. The location of the Metreon lends itself to a few different transportation options. For those looking to take BART or Muni, the Metreon is located about a block from the Powell Street station. For those interested in taking Caltrain, the Metreon is one mile from the King Street station. For those driving, the Fifth and Mission Parking Garage is located directly across 4th Street and offers 24-hour parking.</p>

<p>Once at the Metreon, enter from the Yerba Buena Gardens north entrance (behind Lemonade if you’re coming from Mission Street).</p>

<p>After entering, take the stairs, escalators, or elevator up to the Mezzanine level for registration. The event will be distributed throughout the AMC Metreon 16 located on the third floor and the City View event space located on the fourth floor. However, you must first register on the Mezzanine to have access to these areas. To expedite registration, please have your QR code and proof of vaccination with ID ready.</p>

<p>If you pre-purchased a t-shirt or other merchandise, these will be available for pick up on the fourth floor (City View) at Coat Check beginning at 11am on Saturday. Please make sure you have your registration QR code ready for scanning.</p>

<h3 id="before-you-attend">Before You Attend</h3>

Our updated 2022 dates therefore will be <strong>June 4-5, 2022</strong> still held at City View of Metreon in downtown San Francisco, CA.</p>

<p>Our goal continues to be bookending RSAC (holding our event the weekend before), as we appreciate the overlap in participants this affords us. Additionally, with the rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant, we feel not hosting an in-person event during this tumultuous time is in the best interest of our community.</p>

<p>We understand this is a sudden disruption, especially with the conference so close at hand. The pandemic has unfortunately caused a lot of unpredictability with hosting in-person events.</p>

<p>We are actively working to notify all participants, presenters, sponsors, villages, volunteers, and vendors regarding the postponement and will be updating our websites and social media outlets as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>We hope you will still be able to join us in June.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, we concluded our first virtual BSidesSF! We appreciate everyone who joined us for four days of education, community, and collaboration. Over the course of the event and in the days following, we saw 2360+ views across 22 talks/presentations for a total of 810+ hours of view time.</p>

<p>If you’d like to watch a talk (yet) again, all talks played this year are available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/BSidesSFTV">BSidesSF YouTube channel</a>. In addition to the talks and presentations, we also ran a 42 challenge CTF. 240 teams with a total of 631 players solved at least one challenge and submitted a total of 1614 flags.</p>

<p>As with years past, this year we again raised money for three deserving charities through the sales of BSidesSF merchandise. EFF, Hackers for Charity, and the Malala Fund all will be receiving great donations thanks to you all. For those who pre-ordered swag, we expect to ship all items by the end of next month.</p>

<p>After running a virtual event this year, we are considering adding a virtual component to next year’s live in-person event. To help inform our 2022 event, we want to know what you enjoyed this year and how we can do better. To provide your feedback, please take a moment to complete our short <a href="/feedback">survey</a>.</p>

<h2 id="saturdays-talks">Saturday’s Talks</h2>

<p>Opening remarks will be followed by <em>Switched On: Behavioral Science, Hypervigilance, and the Human Impact of Cyber-Defense and Crisis Management</em>, sponsored by Netflix. This 50 minute live panel discussion will focus on the mental health impact of the pandemic in the workplace. We will hear from experts in mental health, security, and neuroleadership on how to cope in what is an unprecedentedly stressful time. The panel session will be followed by 30 minutes of live Q&amp;A via Reddit.</p>

<p>A Reddit post will accompany each session, and we encourage you to participate as the presenters will be facilitating Q&amp;A. The talks for Saturday are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Visualizing Security</em> by Jay Jacobs</li>
  <li><em>Non-Political Security Learnings from the Mueller Report</em> by Arkadiy Tetelman</li>
  <li><em>Hacking the Law: Are Bug Bounties a True Safe Harbor?</em> by Amit Elazari</li>
  <li><em>Friend for Replicant? How Attackers Automate and Disguise Themselves in a Shroud of Authenticity to Gain Followers, Control Influence, and Malign Credit</em> by Anna Westelius</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to talks, we will also have village presentations from Lockpick Extreme and OWASP.</p>
