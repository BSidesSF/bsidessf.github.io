    <h1 class="post-title">COVID-19 Safety Policy</h1>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p><strong>Last Updated</strong>: March 19, 2023</p>

<p>Your health and safety is our top priority. We are closely monitoring current community spread, as well as the recommendations provided by both the San Francisco and California Departments of Public Health and the CDC. Our guidance is based on such recommendations and transmission risk levels.</p>

<p>Things can change at any time, especially with the arrival of new variants. As such, this policy is subject to change at anytime as more information becomes available or if regulatory requirements are imposed. If we change this policy in any material way, we will strive to provide updates via this page, our newsletter, blog, and/or social media.</p>

<p><strong>We strongly encourage</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wearing masks</strong> to protect yourself and other participants. We will have masks available at the event for your use.</li>
  <li><strong>Being vaccinated</strong> to the fullest extent you are eligible.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly sanitizing your hands</strong>. Hand sanitizer will be available throughout the venue.</li>
  <li><strong>Taking an at-home COVID-19 test</strong> prior to and following the event.</li>
  <li><strong>Review all current guidance</strong> provided by the CDC and your local health authority, as well as any relevant travel restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not feeling well?</strong> Out of respect for everyone’s health, we ask that you do not attend if any of the following is true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are not feeling well.</li>
  <li>You have any of the symptoms related to COVID-19, especially loss of taste or smell and/or fever.</li>
  <li>You have been in contact with someone diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID-19 within the last 10 days.</li>
  <li>You have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 10 days.</li>
  <li>The CDC Guidelines indicate that you should quarantine or limit your exposure to other people, especially due to COVID-19.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be explicitly clear, if you were exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 or have been told by a healthcare provider, public health authority, or you suspect that you may have been exposed: regardless of your symptoms, recent test status, your vaccination status, or if you have had a previous infection within the previous 10 days, <strong><u>please stay away</u>.</strong> A MASK is not the same as STAY AWAY.</p>

<p>If at any time during the event you feel unwell, start experiencing symptoms, or test positive for COVID-19, please notify one of our staffers and promptly leave the venue.</p>

<h2 id="measures-were-taking">Measures we’re taking</h2>

<p><strong>Improved Ventilation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the AMC theaters, fresh, outdoor air is constantly circulated by opening HVAC dampers, running supply fans, and by running exhaust fans 24/7. The filtration systems have also been upgraded beyond the industry standard of MERV 8 to MERV 13 filters. MERV 13 filters capture the tiniest of droplets, which could contain the COVID-19 virus, whereas the industry standard MERV 8 filter does not.</li>
  <li>In the City View space, a large (11,000 sq. ft.) outdoor space is available, and we will open doors for fresh air where feasible.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Surface Cleaning</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AMC Metreon: Frequently touched surfaces are routinely cleaned and sanitized using EPA registered products and tactics.</li>
  <li>In the City View space, housekeeping is regularly cleaning the bathrooms.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sanitizing</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the AMC theatres, Clorox® Disinfecting Wipes &amp; Hand Sanitizer will be available. Take advantage of the sanitizer and Clorox® disinfecting wipe stations throughout the theaters.</li>
  <li>In the City View space, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol and disinfectant wipes will be available throughout the event space. Please make liberal use of them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Handwashing</strong>: Multiple bathrooms are available with soap and water. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds in accordance with CDC/WHO guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Signage</strong>: Signage highlighting healthy habits will be posted throughout the event space.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p><strong>Masks</strong>: We recommend that individuals wear a well-fitted mask in indoor public settings based on three factors.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You should consider your own risk tolerance.</li>
  <li>You should consider the overall level of community transmission, such as when future variants occur or when cases increase.</li>
  <li>You should consider whether you or someone with whom you work or live is at risk of severe disease.</li>
</ol>

<p>Wear masks that fit well and filter out the virus. To work, masks must fit well over your nose and mouth. Wear masks with good filtration. They block virus particles from going through the mask itself.</p>

<p>Know which masks provide the best protection against COVID-19:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Most Effective</th>
      <th>More Effective</th>
      <th>Effective</th>
      <th>Least Effective</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>• <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Get-the-Most-out-of-Masking.aspx#N95">N95</a></td>

      <td>• <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Get-the-Most-out-of-Masking.aspx#surgical-masks">Surgical Mask</a></td>
      <td>• <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Get-the-Most-out-of-Masking.aspx#cloth-masks">Fabric mask</a> with three or <br />more cloth layers</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>No matter what kind of mask you wear, check the fit and eliminate gaps above the nose or on the sides. Gaps will significantly reduce the effectiveness of any mask.</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h2>

<p><strong>Refund</strong>: If you are not able to attend due to health reasons or your inability to comply with this policy, please contact <a href="mailto:tickets@bsidessf.org">tickets@bsidessf.org</a> to request a refund for your registration. Refunds may be granted at our discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please reach out to <a href="mailto:info@bsidessf.org">info@bsidessf.org</a>.</p>
