# Get to the conference
Welcome to BSidesSF 2018!  To get to the conference, enter the Metreon through the Yerba Buena entrance and take the escalators or elevator to the 4th floor.  Stop by the registration desk (open 9am-6pm Sunday and 9am-4pm Monday) to pick up your badge, and then go enjoy some awesome talks, people, villages, and workshops!
