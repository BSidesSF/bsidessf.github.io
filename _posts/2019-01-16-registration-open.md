It's that time again - registration for BSidesSF 2019 is now open! Get your tickets here: <https://bsidessf.regfox.com/2019> and join us Sunday, March 3rd and Monday, March 4th. Our workshops are also coming back this year but with a twist! We’ll be holding them off-site at Splunk HQ on Saturday, March 2nd. Workshop slots are first come, first serve, so if you’re interested, sign-up while seats are still available.

All tickets include breakfast and lunch both days, multiple drinks, and admission to the awesome Sunday Night Party!

See you in March ~
