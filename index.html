      <b>BSidesSF 2021 is fully virtual this year with our Recharge themed event!</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      In the spirit of returning and restoring, we've decided to revisit some of the
      highlights from past events as well as feature a select few new sessions. Over
      the course of four days we will be hosting two mental health-focused keynotes,
      four village presentations, and a CTF as well as replaying some awesome past
      talks!

      All sessions will be streamed live to our YouTube channel and paired with
      presenter Q&A facilitated via Reddit.
