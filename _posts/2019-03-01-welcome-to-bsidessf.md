The final countdown is on to BSidesSF 2019! 

**Getting to the Event**

We are back once again at the Metreon located at 135 4th Street in downtown San Francisco. The location of the Metreon lends itself to a few different transportation options. For those looking to take BART, the Metreon is located only a couple of blocks from the Powell Street station. For those interested in taking Caltrain, the Metreon is one mile from the King Street station. For those driving, the Fifth and Mission Parking Garage is located directly across Fourth Street and offers 24-hour parking.

The Metreon will be closed to the general public until 10:30am both Sunday and Monday, so you will need to enter through the Yerba Buena Gardens entrance located most closely to Mission Street. Once you are inside of the Metreon, take the stairs, escalators, or elevator up to the Mezzanine level for registration. The event will be distributed throughout the AMC Metreon 16 located on the third floor and the City View event space located on the fourth floor, but you must first register on the Mezzanine to have access to these areas. To expedite registration, please have your QR code ready.

If you pre-purchased a t-shirt, these can be picked up on the fourth floor beginning at 12:15pm on Sunday.

**Before You Attend**

Before you attend the event, we ask that you review our [Code of Conduct](https://bsidessf.org/about/code-of-conduct.html)  as well as our [Photo and Video Policies](https://bsidessf.org/about/photo-policy.html). We require that all guests show respect and tolerance for each other’s uniqueness. We have no tolerance for physical, verbal, or sexual harassment; intimidation; or marginalization of any human! 

**Two Full Days of Talks, Events, and Happenings**

The full schedule of events can be found on [Sched](https://bsidessf2019.sched.com/). All talks, villages, and the CTF are open to any and all conference participants; if there is an open seat, it’s yours. The Living Security Escape Room runs multiple times each day, and registration is necessary as only eight individuals can participate at one time. Registration is available on-site, but times may fill-up quickly so [pre-registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsidessf-security-escape-room-presented-by-living-security-tickets-56370646120)  is recommended.

We encourage all participants to take a stroll through the Sponsor Lounge, which will include representatives from some of the organizations that made this year’s event possible. Many of our sponsors are actively recruiting, so we encourage you to stop by their booths to learn more if you are interested in new opportunities. We'd like to bring special attention to these sponsors who have called out recruiting as a key reason for their sponsorship: [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/careers/), [Cmd](https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Cmd-923823e9/about), [Google](https://careers.google.com/jobs/), [Verizon Media](https://www.oath.com/careers/work-at-oath/) , [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/jobs).
