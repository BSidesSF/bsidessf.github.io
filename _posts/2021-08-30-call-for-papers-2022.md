BSidesSF is excited to open the Call for Presentations and Call for Workshops for the BSidesSF 2022 conference. The 2022 event will be held at City View at Metreon in San Francisco on Saturday, February 5th & Sunday, February 6th. The Workshops will take place around or on the same dates at a separate venue that will be announced closer to the event.

Our Call for Presentations process is fairly standard, but please do take the time to read through the information, as there are changes every year.

To all of you who think you have something to say â€“ take a look and get writing. You have until October 11th to make your submission.

For complete details and information on how to submit, check out the [Call for Presentations](/cfp.html) and the [Call for Workshops](/cfw.html).

Spread the word!
