<p>We want to ensure everybody’s participation is amazing, so please read below for important information concerning this year’s event.</p>

<h3 id="getting-to-the-event">Getting to the Event</h3>

<p>We are back once again at the Metreon located at 135 4th Street in downtown San Francisco. The location of the Metreon lends itself to a few different transportation options. For those looking to take BART or Muni, the Metreon is located about a block from the Powell Street station. For those interested in taking Caltrain, the Metreon is one mile from the King Street station. For those driving, the Fifth and Mission Parking Garage is located directly across 4th Street and offers 24-hour parking.</p>

<p>Once at the Metreon, enter from the Yerba Buena Gardens north entrance (behind Lemonade if you’re coming from Mission Street).</p>

<p>After entering, take the stairs, escalators, or elevator up to the Mezzanine level for registration. The event will be distributed throughout the AMC Metreon 16 located on the third floor and the City View event space located on the fourth floor. However, you must first register on the Mezzanine to have access to these areas. To expedite registration, please have your QR code and proof of vaccination with ID ready.</p>

<p>If you pre-purchased a t-shirt or other merchandise, these will be available for pick up on the fourth floor (City View) at Coat Check beginning at 11am on Saturday. Please make sure you have your registration QR code ready for scanning.</p>

<h3 id="before-you-attend">Before You Attend</h3>

<p>Before you attend the event, we ask that you review our <a href="/about/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, our <a href="/about/photo-policy">Photo and Video Policies</a>, and our <a href="/about/covid-19-safety-policy">COVID-19 Safety Policy</a>. We require that all guests abide by our policies and show respect and tolerance for each other’s uniqueness. We have no tolerance for physical, verbal, or sexual harassment; intimidation; or marginalization of any human! Additionally, due to venue restrictions, please note we only allow service animals at the event and will not be able to store bikes or scooters within the venue.</p>

<p>To summarize our <a href="/about/covid-19-safety-policy">COVID-19 Safety Policy</a> (please review the entire policy):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proof of completed vaccination is required. Medical, religious, or philosophical objections will not be accepted. We also highly recommend that if you are eligible that you have received at least one booster dose.</li>
  <li>The name on your ID and your proof of vaccination must match.</li>
  <li>Masks must be worn at all times while indoors at the event, except when you are 1) actively eating or drinking; or 2) a presenter actively giving your talk/workshop. Masks must be worn completely over both your mouth and nose.</li>
  <li>If you feel sick, please don’t come.</li>
  <li>We highly recommend you self-test at home prior to coming.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="two-full-days-of-talks-events-and-happenings">Two Full Days of Talks, Events, and Happenings</h3>

<p>Doors will open at 9am and talks begin at 10am. The full schedule of events can be found on <a href="https://bsidessf2022.sched.com/">Sched</a> and HackerTracker (on Android and iOS). All talks, villages, and the CTF are open to any and all participants; if there is an open seat, it’s yours. For questions during talks, we will be using <a href="slido.com">Slido</a> with code #BSidesSF2022.</p>

<p>We encourage all participants to take a stroll through the Participant Hall and visit all our sponsors, without whom this event would not be possible. Many of our sponsors are actively recruiting, so we encourage you to stop by their booths to learn more if you are interested in new opportunities. We’ll be raffling off some really awesome items, so make sure to get your Sponsor Passport stamped and turned in prior to the daily raffle (12:30-1pm each day).</p>

Our updated 2022 dates therefore will be <strong>June 4-5, 2022</strong> still held at City View of Metreon in downtown San Francisco, CA.</p>

<p>Our goal continues to be bookending RSAC (holding our event the weekend before), as we appreciate the overlap in participants this affords us. Additionally, with the rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant, we feel not hosting an in-person event during this tumultuous time is in the best interest of our community.</p>

<p>We understand this is a sudden disruption, especially with the conference so close at hand. The pandemic has unfortunately caused a lot of unpredictability with hosting in-person events.</p>

<p>We are actively working to notify all participants, presenters, sponsors, villages, volunteers, and vendors regarding the postponement and will be updating our websites and social media outlets as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>We hope you will still be able to join us in June.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, we concluded our first virtual BSidesSF! We appreciate everyone who joined us for four days of education, community, and collaboration. Over the course of the event and in the days following, we saw 2360+ views across 22 talks/presentations for a total of 810+ hours of view time.</p>

<p>If you’d like to watch a talk (yet) again, all talks played this year are available on the <a href="https://youtube.com/@BSidesSF">BSidesSF YouTube channel</a>. In addition to the talks and presentations, we also ran a 42 challenge CTF. 240 teams with a total of 631 players solved at least one challenge and submitted a total of 1614 flags.</p>

<p>As with years past, this year we again raised money for three deserving charities through the sales of BSidesSF merchandise. EFF, Hackers for Charity, and the Malala Fund all will be receiving great donations thanks to you all. For those who pre-ordered swag, we expect to ship all items by the end of next month.</p>

<p>After running a virtual event this year, we are considering adding a virtual component to next year’s live in-person event. To help inform our 2022 event, we want to know what you enjoyed this year and how we can do better. To provide your feedback, please take a moment to complete our short <a href="/feedback">survey</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, speaking of next year’s event, please mark your calendar for BSidesSF 2022 on <del>February 5th &amp; 6th</del> June 4th &amp; 5th (and <a href="/subscribe.html">subscribe for updates</a>)!
