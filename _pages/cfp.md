# **What**

BSidesSF is a non-profit organization designed to advance the body of Information 
Security knowledge, by providing an annual, open forum for discussion and debate for 
security practitioners. We produce a conference that is a source of education, 
collaboration, and continued conversation for information technologists. The technical 
and academic presentations at BSidesSF are given in the spirit of peer review and 
advanced knowledge dissemination. This allows the field of Information Security to grow 
in breadth and depth, and continue in its pursuit of highly advanced, scientifically 
based knowledge.

We are a practitioner-focused event that attracts a wide range of attendees ranging 
from engineers & security leaders to executive decision makers. This is a great 
opportunity for you to showcase your work and share your ideas with industry peers. 
Bonus points if you can tie your presentation to this yearâ€™s conference theme!

The BSides community has continuously raised the bar and put the info back in 
infosec. We thank each and every member/participant/organizer of this community for 
their hard work, sweat, and relentless pursuit of making high quality content accessible.
We celebrate diverse approaches and points of view and believe that our commitment to 
diversity fosters innovation. BSidesSF is continuing to build upon a culture that drives 
our community to include a wide range of thoughts and ideas.

Note: We **DO NOT** provide speaker or travel reimbursements at this time (except on a 
case-by-case basis with villages). We also DO NOT accept vendor pitches of any 
sort in our conference program. Thank you for your understanding.

# **When/Where**

BSidesSF will take place on March 21-22, 2026. The conference will be located 
at City View at the Metreon in downtown San Francisco.

# **Theme**

ðŸŽµ **BSidesSF: The Musical** ðŸŽ¶  

This year, weâ€™re turning up the volume and spotlighting the rhythm of security.  
Like a musical score where harmony meets dissonance, todayâ€™s infosec landscape is a 
composition of challenges, innovations, and unexpected crescendos.  
Weâ€™re calling on our community to take the stage: share your symphonies of success, 
your improvisations during incidents, and your orchestrations of offense.  

Whether your talk is a solo act or part of a larger ensemble, come help us make BSidesSF 
2026 a performance to remember!
