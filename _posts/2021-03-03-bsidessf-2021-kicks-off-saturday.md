## Saturday's Talks

Opening remarks will be followed by _Switched On: Behavioral Science, Hypervigilance, and the Human Impact of Cyber-Defense and Crisis Management_, sponsored by Netflix. This 50 minute live panel discussion will focus on the mental health impact of the pandemic in the workplace. We will hear from experts in mental health, security, and neuroleadership on how to cope in what is an unprecedentedly stressful time. The panel session will be followed by 30 minutes of live Q&A via Reddit.

A Reddit post will accompany each session, and we encourage you to participate as the presenters will be facilitating Q&A. The talks for Saturday are as follows:

* _Visualizing Security_ by Jay Jacobs
* _Non-Political Security Learnings from the Mueller Report_ by Arkadiy Tetelman
* _Hacking the Law: Are Bug Bounties a True Safe Harbor?_ by Amit Elazari
* _Friend for Replicant? How Attackers Automate and Disguise Themselves in a Shroud of Authenticity to Gain Followers, Control Influence, and Malign Credit_ by Anna Westelius

In addition to talks, we will also have village presentations from Lockpick Extreme and OWASP.

All of the talks will be streamed on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvWn6Nne_Jj8IkLXZP3tgE6), and all of the Reddit posts can be found on our subreddit, [r/BSidesSF](https://www.reddit.com/r/BSidesSF/).
