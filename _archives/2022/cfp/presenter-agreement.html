    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>

    <p>Security B-Sides, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, organizes the BSides San Francisco conference (collectively, “BSidesSF”) as an information security conference that is a source of education, collaboration, and continued conversation for information technologists and those associated with this field. The technical and academic presentations and other material presented in connection with BSidesSF events are presented in the spirit of peer review and knowledge dissemination. This agreement concerns the presentation you plan to give at the BSidesSF event described in Exhibit A, whether presented live at the event venue, provided in pre-recorded form, or streamed from a location other than the event venue (your “Presentation”), as well as any other material you provide to BSidesSF in connection with your Presentation or otherwise provide to BSidesSF under this agreement (your “Material”).</p>

    <p>Thank you for your willingness to present at BSidesSF!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cancellations by Presenters / Notice to BSidesSF</strong></p>

    <p>If you are presenting at a BSidesSF event, you agree promptly to notify the primary point of contact of the event via telephone/email if you are unable to present at the agreed date and time, or to provide pre-recorded presentation content prior to the agreed deadline, so that BSidesSF may find an alternate presenter for your session. If you violate the terms of this agreement or fail to meet any established deadlines, BSidesSF reserves the right to replace you as a presenter, either with another presenter with knowledge of your presentation or an unrelated presenter, at the sole discretion of BSidesSF.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consideration</strong></p>

    <p>You grant the licenses and permissions in this agreement in exchange for the opportunity to present your Presentation and/or Material to the BSidesSF community and, for events at which you speak in-person, in exchange for a single non-transferable admission pass to the BSidesSF event at which you speak in-person. You will receive no other remuneration, and BSidesSF will not reimburse any of your costs or expenses related to attending. BSidesSF reserves the right to cancel your Presentation and/or to cease distribution of your Material for any reason, with or without prior notice, and BSidesSF will not be liable to you as a result of such action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code of Conduct / Content of the Presentation and Material</strong></p>

    <p>You understand that BSidesSF has NO TOLERANCE for physical, verbal, sexual, or other forms of harassment, intimidation, or marginalization of any human being. You have read and agree to abide by the BSidesSF Code of Conduct at <a href="/about/code-of-conduct">https://bsidessf.org/about/code-of-conduct.html</a>, as amended from time to time, which is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this agreement.</p>

    <p>You understand that the views and opinions expressed at the event will be yours and not those of BSidesSF.</p>

    <p>Presenters are encouraged to include their contact information when introducing themselves and may include their company name and logo if they so choose but are discouraged from including their company name and logo on any subsequent slides or on other materials. Presenters are to avoid the appearance of commercialism in their session and Presentations and/or Materials are to be of a technical, educational, or solutions emphasis. The program tracks of the event are educational events, not a sales or marketing platform. You agree that your Presentation and/or Material will be an objective review of the topic(s) on which you are presenting, reflective of the current state of the topic(s) you are addressing, and will not contain any content that is a sales or promotional pitch for any specific product(s) or company(ies). You agree to disclose any conflicts of interest related to your Presentation and/or Material.</p>

    <p>BSidesSF is not an appropriate forum for discussing vulnerabilities that have not been responsibly disclosed, and in particular, you agree that you will not discuss any vulnerabilities unless you have complied with prevailing responsible disclosure standards in the security industry, including without limitation providing adequate advance disclosure to all affected vendors, such that the vendors have had a reasonable amount of time to patch affected products and systems. If you discuss vulnerabilities, you agree to dedicate a substantial portion of your Presentation and/or Material to solutions for any issues raised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consent to Audiovisual Recording</strong></p>

    <p>You hereby give BSidesSF and its designated agents and service providers permission to create – and to permit others to create – photographs, copies, and audiovisual recordings of any type in any medium, of your Presentation and/or Material, including permission to create copies of any file(s) or live stream(s) through which your Presentation and/or Material are provided.</p>

    <p>BSidesSF cannot guarantee, but will use reasonable efforts, to prevent the recording of Presentations given as part of an advertised OTR / “off the record” track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>License to BSidesSF</strong></p>

    <p>As between you and BSidesSF, you will maintain all ownership rights in and to your Presentation and/or Material, including copyrights.</p>

    <p>BSidesSF’s mission is in part to broadly disseminate technical and educational information. To further that purpose, you hereby grant BSidesSF a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable license to copy, use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform, and publicly display your Presentation and/or Material, or any portion thereof, in any manner or medium now known or hereafter developed, and to permit others to do so, without restriction of any kind, and for any purpose whatsoever, including any commercial purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes, but is not limited to making your Presentation and/or Material available to other BSides-branded organizations and posting your Presentation and/or Material on the BSidesSF website, YouTube channel, social media, streaming media, and the like.</p>

    <p>You irrevocably waive (and represent and warrant that you have obtained an irrevocable written waiver by each creator of the Presentation and/or Materials), to the extent permitted by applicable law, all rights of paternity, integrity, attribution, disclosure, withdrawal, and any other rights that may be known as “moral rights” with respect to the use of the Presentation and/or Materials as allowed in this agreement.</p>

    <p>BSidesSF will make reasonable efforts to ensure that its use of your Presentation and/or Materials is marked with appropriate copyright notices you specify, if any, in a reasonably prominent position, subject to platform limitations.</p>

    <p>You hereby grant BSidesSF a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable right to use your name, likeness, image, and biographical information in connection with the Presentation and/or Material (including promotional uses related to the Presentation and/or Material and any websites, events, or other media where the Presentation and/or Material or portions thereof may be hosted or made available), and hereby waive any and all rights and claims related thereto, including without limitation claims based on invasion of privacy, disclosure, defamation, rights of publicity, copyright, and moral rights that may arise out of such use described herein, in any jurisdiction, now or in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Your Presentation Should Not Be Infringing or Otherwise Illegal</strong></p>

    <p>You affirm that you have the right to enter into this agreement and are not restricted by any conflicting commitments to third parties.</p>

    <p>You represent and warrant that the exercise by BSidesSF of the permissions and licenses granted under this agreement will not infringe or otherwise conflict with the rights of any other person or entity, and that you have obtained all licenses, permissions, waivers, and consents (including those relating to privacy and publicity rights, and intellectual property rights) necessary for BSidesSF to use the Presentation and/or Material as permitted under this agreement.</p>

    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BSidesSF and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, sublicensees, successors, and assigns from and against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, penalties, fines, fees, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in connection with any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding relating to any actual or alleged: (a) breach of any of your representations, warranties, or obligations under this agreement, or (b) infringement or other violation of any intellectual property or other personal or proprietary rights of any person or entity resulting from the use of your Presentation and/or Material by BSidesSF or any of its affiliates or sublicensees in accordance with this agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>

    <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and BSidesSF with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements between you and BSidesSF with respect to the same. This agreement may only be modified by a writing signed by both you and BSidesSF.</p>

    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. Any disputes under this agreement may be brought exclusively in the state courts and the Federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</p>

    <p>The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither party has authority to contract for nor bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
