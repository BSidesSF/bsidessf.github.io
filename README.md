BSidesSF Website
=================

Theme is based on [Slim Pickins](https://chrisanthropic.github.io/slim-pickins-jekyll-theme/).

Thanks to [ShmooCon](http://shmoocon.org/) for some navigation and content help.

Running Locally
=================

To run the site locally, run ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` on the command line. The address will be listed as ```Server address``` in the output when this runs correctly.

If this isn't working, you may need to run ```bundle install``` to ensure you have the necessary gems.
