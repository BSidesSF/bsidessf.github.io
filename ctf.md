[Register and play here](https://ctf.bsidessf.net/)! (April 15th @ 9am PT - April 16th @ 4pm PT)

The CTF is back and as wild as ever.

You can play on-site in the CTF room (SoMa) during the conference or online. However, only folks who are on-site will be able to win prizes.

The challenges are targeted towards beginner and intermediate players, but there are several harder challenges as well!

There are folks on-site in the CTF room (SoMa) and in our [Slack room](https://bsidessf-slack.herokuapp.com) ([#ctf](https://bsidessf.slack.com/messages/C2DSB8VDL/)) to answer any questions.

*This year's CTF is sponsored by HackerOne.*

### E-mail ctf [at] bsidessf.org for questions.
