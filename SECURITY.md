## Reporting a Vulnerability

The BSidesSF staff takes all vulnerability reports seriously. Thank you for
improving the security of BSidesSF. We appreciate your efforts and responsible
disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report any potential security vulnerabilities by emailing security [@] bsidessf.org.

A member of the BSidesSF security team will acknowledge your email as soon as
possible, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the
next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the
security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
and announcement (as needed), and may ask for additional information or
guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party services to the person or team maintaining
the service.

## Disclosure Policy

primary handler. This person will coordinate the issue, involving the following
steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected systems.
  * Audit code/infrastructure to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare and/or coordinate fixes for any affected code/infrastructure.
