Interested in helping at BSidesSF 2018?

BSidesSF is a 100% volunteer-run event and simply wouldn't be possible without the help of our awesome community. If you're interested in helping, take a look at [our volunteer page](/volunteer.html) for current openings. In exchange for at least four hours of your time, you'll receive free admission and meals during the conference.

If you have any questions, please contact volunteer [@] bsidessf.org or join [#volunteers on our Slack](https://bsidessf.slack.com/messages/C0CSQ1TTN).
