# Interested in helping at BSidesSF 2020?

BSidesSF is a security event that would not be possible without the work of our local community. Every year, the organizers work hard to build a fun and exciting agenda so you can experience the latest in cool security happenings. However, we rely on contributions from volunteers like you to help with various tasks on the three days of the event. Join us!

## What's in it for me?

Volunteering is a great way to get involved with the local security community, especially if you are a newcomer. It’s a good chance to meet other security-minded people while picking up various skills along the way.  All volunteers that work for a **minimum of 6 hours** will get a free BSidesSF t-shirt + badge (and food), which means you can attend talks during the times that you are not volunteering. All we ask is that you dedicate those hours of your time to help us out!

## What type of volunteers are you looking for?

Anyone and everyone! If you’re even remotely interested, keep reading because we’d love to work with you. BSidesSF aims to strengthen our security community by engaging different perspectives from different backgrounds. No two volunteers are alike so we aim to provide opportunities for all personality types and skill sets. Take a look at our role descriptions below for a better idea of which opportunities might be right for you.

At the same time, we realize that not every role will be suitable for every volunteer. For each role, we will mention possible gotchas in order to provide an inclusive experience for all our volunteers. This year, we are adding the following classifications to our roles:

- Roles that require lots of interactions with people
- Roles that may have high noise/sensory effects
- Roles that require mobility
- Roles that may require standing
- Roles that require strength
- URM-only shifts: women/nonbinary, LGBTQ+, PoC

We will also clearly highlight accessibility features within the venue for those who require it. And as always, we are open to feedback! Please let us know of any concerns you have in your request to volunteer, and we will work to provide any possible accommodations.

## What tasks need to be done?

We group our volunteer opportunities into several pools.

- **Attendee-Facing** - these roles require strong communication skills and attendee interaction, including General Registration / Information Desk, Room Proctoring, and Coat Check.

- **Behind-the-Scenes** - these roles require higher levels of operational experience and agency, including Bag Stuffing, Setup/Teardown.

- **Public Safety** - these roles overall will require strong mobility and communication skills.

When you sign up for a shift slot, you will pick one of these larger pools and you will work in one or more of the given roles inside that pool depending on volunteer availability and accessibility needs. See the descriptions below for more information about each opportunity.

## What if I don’t know how to do any of these?

Our volunteer leads **will train you** for the specific tasks you sign up for, and there will also be volunteer **Q&A sessions prior to the event**. Please try to make time to be available on **Saturday, February 22, 2020** for training and Q&A.

## Can you provide proof of my volunteer hours?
Absolutely! Reach out to volunteers@bsidessf.org after the conference and we will provide the necessary documentation.

Does your employer offer a charitable giving program? If so, they can donate money to BSidesSF based on your volunteer hours. Reach out to your company’s HR team for more information.

BSidesSF is a [registered 501c3 nonprofit](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/271830464) so if you like the work we do, we would really appreciate your employer’s donation!
