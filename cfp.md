**About BSidesSF**

BSidesSF is a non-profit organization designed to advance the body of Information Security knowledge, by providing an annual, two day, open forum for discussion and debate for security engineers and their affiliates. We produce a conference that is a source of education, collaboration, and continued conversation for information technologists and those associated with this field. The technical and academic presentations at BSidesSF are given in the spirit of peer review and advanced knowledge dissemination. This allows the field of Information Security to grow in breadth and depth, and continue in its pursuit of highly advanced scientifically based knowledge.

The BSides community has continuously raised the bar and put the INFO back in INFOSEC. We thank each and every member/participant/organizer of this community for their hard work, sweat, and relentless pursuit of High Quality information.

With some of the most passionate and influential infosec practitioners from around the country, and the world, coming to RSA Conference, BSidesSF is the place to be. The mix ranges from “down in the trenches” engineers, to business leaders, thought leaders, and executive decision makers of all stripes.

# Suggested topics that match this year's theme of "80s":

**Who Should Submit?**
New and seasoned speakers alike.  We are interested in all talks, but most importantly talks that focus around fixing problems and not just finding them.  We encourage individuals who have never spoken to submit and/or individuals who want to present their new research.  BSidesSF is a no judgement zone.

**What Not to Submit?**
- Something you are planning to do, but have not done yet (time flies and life gets busy)
- Vendor talks - a talk centered around the product and/or company you work for
- Something you have presented time and time again and isn't updated
- Talks about just breaking things - These are cool, but do not promote security the right way

# What You Need
- Speaker name(s) and contact information
- Bio(s)
- Talk Title
- Abstract - Limited to 200 words
- Detailed Outline or description of your topic.  Tell us what your presentation is really about and why people will want to attend.  Your abstract is not enough information.
- List of conferences at which submission has been presented or submitted.
- Why do you feel this submission is a good fit for BSidesSF?
- Are you a potential first time presenter at BSidesSF? Have you spoken at any other conferences? If yes, which ones?
