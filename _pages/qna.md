## How to Use Slido

Slido allows you to directly interact with the speakers by asking questions during the sessions. Below are guidelines to enhance your experience and ensure a smooth process:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Access Slido**
   - You can access Slido by scanning the QR code provided at the venue or by clicking on the link [here](https://app.sli.do/event/oqXWxYFPwSacPNv5D4Y2k6). You can also join go to [slido.com](https://www.slido.com) and enter the code `BSidesSF2025`.

2. **Select the Correct Room**
   - Make sure you select the correct room for the session you are attending. Questions are room-specific and will not make sense if asked in the wrong session.

3. **Be Respectful**
   - Respect other participants and speakers. Constructive and respectful questions enhance the value of the discussion.

4. **Viewing and Voting on Questions**
   - You can view questions others have asked. If you find a question that you would also like to see answered, please give it an 'upvote' rather than submitting the same question again.

5. **Asking Questions**
   - When you ask a question, make sure it is clear and concise. This will increase the likelihood of your question being addressed during the session.

### Tips for Effective Use

- Keep your questions relevant to the session topic.
- Use the upvote feature to agree with questions already posed instead of posting duplicate questions.
- Follow any additional guidelines posted by the moderators or event organizers.
