BSidesSF is soliciting submissions for the annual BSidesSF conference on April 
26-27, 2025. Call for Participation is currently open for all tracks.

# **What**

BSidesSF is a non-profit organization designed to advance the body of Information 
Security knowledge, by providing an annual, open forum for discussion and debate for 
security practitioners. We produce a conference that is a source of education, 
collaboration, and continued conversation for information technologists. The technical 
and academic presentations at BSidesSF are given in the spirit of peer review and 
advanced knowledge dissemination. This allows the field of Information Security to grow 
in breadth and depth, and continue in its pursuit of highly advanced, scientifically 
based knowledge.

We are a practitioner-focused event that attracts a wide range of attendees ranging 
from engineers & security leaders to executive decision makers. This is a great 
opportunity for you to showcase your work and share your ideas with industry peers. 
Bonus points if you can tie your presentation to this year’s conference theme!

The BSides community has continuously raised the bar and put the info back in 
infosec. We thank each and every member/participant/organizer of this community for 
their hard work, sweat, and relentless pursuit of making high quality content accessible.
We celebrate diverse approaches and points of view and believe that our commitment to 
diversity fosters innovation. BSidesSF is continuing to build upon a culture that drives 
our community to include a wide range of thoughts and ideas.

# **When/Where**

BSidesSF will take place on April 26-27, 2025. The conference will be located 
at City View at the Metreon in downtown San Francisco.

# **Theme**

This year, we dive into uncharted territory of security under the theme "Here Be 
Dragons." Like the ancient maps that marked unknown regions with dragons, today's 
landscape is filled with threats that are complex, evolving, and often unpredictable. 
As security practitioners, we are the navigators of this vast, sometimes dangerous 
terrain. We're opening the call to participate in our 2025 conference -- come share your 
experiences exploring new challenges, discovering the unknown, battling cutting-edge 
technologies, and sharing strategies to confront the 'dragons' lurking in the shadows. ⚔️
