BSidesSF is excited to open the Call for Participation for the BSidesSF 2025
conference. The 2025 event will be held at City View at Metreon in San
Francisco on Saturday, April 26th & Sunday, April 27th.

Our Call for Participation (CFP) process is fairly standard, but please do take
the time to read through the information, as there are changes every year.
[Read all about it here](/cfp) and spread the word!

Additionally, we are always looking for more sponsors. If you are
interested, check out the [sponsors benefits](/sponsors/benefits)
and reach out to us at <sponsors@bsidessf.org>.
