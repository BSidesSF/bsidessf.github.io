to kick off your BSidesSF 2026 sponsorship.

## What is it?

BSidesSF is an annual conference with a difference. We are a 100% volunteer organized event, put on
by and for the community. The conference is an annual, two-day, open forum for discussion and debate
for security engineers and their affiliates.

## Why sponsor?

-  A touch point with the Bay Area security community (60% of our participants are from the SF Bay area)
-  Exposure to the global Security community (40% of our participants traveled from outside the SF Bay area)
-  Your Name and Logo "Up In Lights" as we are loud about those organizations that support us
-  Good Feels for enabling us to host this amazing conference year after year

## Who attends?

The mix ranges from “down in the trenches” engineers to business leaders, thought leaders, and executive
decision makers of all stripes.
