# Interested in helping at BSidesSF 2019?

BSidesSF is a security event that would not be possible without the work of our local community. Every year, the organizers work hard to build a fun and exciting agenda so that you can experience the latest in cool security happenings. However, as a community event, we rely on contributions from volunteers like you to help with various tasks on the two days of the event. Join us!

***What's in it for me?***

Volunteering is a great way to get involved with the local security scene and community, especially if you are a newcomer. It's a good chance to meet other security-minded people while picking up various skills along the way.  All volunteers that **work for a minimum of 4 hours** will get a free BSidesSF t-shirt + badge (and food), which means you can attend talks during the times that you are not volunteering. All we ask is that you dedicate a few hours of your time to help us out!

***What tasks need to be done?***

- General Registration / Information Desk
- Audio / Visual wrangling
- Room moderators 
- Public Safety
- Speaker wrangling
- Top secret undercover mission
- Room set up and teardown

***What if I don’t know how to do any of these?***

Our volunteer leads will train you for the specific tasks you sign up for, in addition to volunteer Q&A sessions prior to the event. If you have any further questions on what various tasks may mean or entail, feel free to contact us at volunteer@bsidessf.org.

***What if there are specific talks I want to go to?***

We understand that our volunteers will want to attend specific talks, whether it is because of an interesting topic or just to show support for a friend or colleague. We will try our best to work with you to make that possible.

***How do I sign up???***

You can sign up at [https://calendly.com/bsidessf-volunteering-2019](https://calendly.com/bsidessf-volunteering-2019)

Please reach out to volunteer@bsidessf.org with any questions.
