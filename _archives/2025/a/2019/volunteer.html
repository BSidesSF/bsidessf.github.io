<p>BSidesSF is a security event that would not be possible without the work of our local community. Every year, the organizers work hard to build a fun and exciting agenda so that you can experience the latest in cool security happenings. However, as a community event, we rely on contributions from volunteers like you to help with various tasks on the two days of the event. Join us!</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s in it for me?</em></strong></p>

<p>Volunteering is a great way to get involved with the local security scene and community, especially if you are a newcomer. It’s a good chance to meet other security-minded people while picking up various skills along the way.  All volunteers that <strong>work for a minimum of 4 hours</strong> will get a free BSidesSF t-shirt + badge (and food), which means you can attend talks during the times that you are not volunteering. All we ask is that you dedicate a few hours of your time to help us out!</p>

<p><strong><em>What tasks need to be done?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>General Registration / Information Desk</li>
  <li>Audio / Visual wrangling</li>
  <li>Room moderators</li>
  <li>Public Safety</li>
  <li>Speaker wrangling</li>
  <li>Room set up and teardown</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>What if I don’t know how to do any of these?</em></strong></p>

<p>Our volunteer leads will train you for the specific tasks you sign up for, in addition to volunteer Q&amp;A sessions prior to the event. If you have any further questions on what various tasks may mean or entail, feel free to contact us at volunteer@bsidessf.org.</p>

<p><strong><em>What if there are specific talks I want to go to?</em></strong></p>

<p>We understand that our volunteers will want to attend specific talks, whether it is because of an interesting topic or just to show support for a friend or colleague. We will try our best to work with you to make that possible.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I sign up???</em></strong></p>

<p>You can sign up at <a href="https://calendly.com/bsidessf-volunteering-2019">https://calendly.com/bsidessf-volunteering-2019</a></p>
