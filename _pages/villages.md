Villages are informal spaces where communities and organizations reside. Villages host interactive activities (i.e. workshops), foster networking, and otherwise build community in a cozy and welcoming space. Villages run the full duration of the conference. If you desire a space for a shorter duration, consider meetups.

**Call for Villages is now closed.**
