title: "Interested in helping at BSidesSF 2025?"
---

BSidesSF is a security event that would not be possible without the work of our local community. Every year, the organizers work hard to build a fun and exciting agenda so you can experience the latest in cool security happenings. However, we rely on contributions from volunteers like you to help with various tasks leading up to and on the two days of the event. Join us!

# What’s in it for me?

Volunteering is a great way to get involved with the local security community, especially if you are a newcomer. It’s also a good chance to meet other security-minded people while picking up various skills along the way.  All volunteers must work for a minimum of **2 shifts** and will get a free BSidesSF t-shirt + badge as part of their volunteer admission. This means you can attend talks during the times that you are not volunteering. This is a minimum, and if you would like to pick up more shifts 

# What type of volunteers are you looking for?

Anyone and everyone! No two volunteers are alike so we aim to provide opportunities for all personality types and skill sets. Take a look at our role descriptions below for a better idea of which opportunities might be right for you.

At the same time, we realize that not every role will be suitable for every volunteer. For each role, we will mention possible gotchas in order to provide an inclusive experience for all our volunteers. As in previous years, we are adding the following classifications as applicable to our roles:

- Roles that require lots of interactions with people
- Roles that may have high noise/sensory effects
- Roles that require mobility
- Roles that may require excessive standing
- Roles that require strength/lifting

We will also clearly highlight accessibility features within the venue for those who require it. And as always, we are open to feedback! Please let us know in your request to volunteer or by emailing volunteer@bsidessf.org, and we will work to provide any possible accommodations.

# What tasks need to be done?

We group our volunteer opportunities into several pools.

* Attendee-Facing - These roles require frequent or constant attendee interaction, often providing information or helping with registration
* Behind-the-Scenes - These roles require less attendee interaction, but will often require a higher level of agency or operational ability. These roles often involve the setup or teardown of various pieces of the event as it goes along.
* Social Media  - This role will involve documenting the Bsides experience on social media, as well as talk with attendees about their experiences at Bsides.
* Safety Ops - These roles are the eyes, ears, and voices of BsidesSF staff, as well as a friendly face for attendees and other volunteers to go to if something is going wrong. Strong communication skills and a cool head are a major benefit to these roles.
* Track MC's - This attendee-facing role requires that you are comfortable acting as an MC for event talks/workshops. This means you should be able to communicate clearly for both the speaker’s and the audience’s benefit, and ideally have a strong command of the English language. **This role will require a pre-screening, if you'd like to be considered for this role please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/s71guo4qDvkhFGtF9).
* Production Crew - This role mixes attendee-facing and behind-the-scenes work, supporting our speakers, MC's, and program core staff to keep talks running. While you may be asked to perform some public speaking functions, this role is primarily not going to be doing any MC work. **This role will require a pre-screening, if you'd like to be considered for this role please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/s71guo4qDvkhFGtF9).

When you sign up for a shift slot, you will pick one of these larger pools and you will work in one or more of the given roles inside that pool depending on volunteer availability and accessibility needs. For more information on the individual roles, see descriptions below.

# What if I don’t know how to do any of these?

Our volunteer leads **will train you** for the specific tasks you sign up for, and there will also be volunteer **Q&A sessions prior to the event**. Please try to make time to be available on **Friday, April 25th, 2025** at **12PM-1PM** or **6-7PM** for training and Q&A.

# What if the shift I want is filled up?

You can sign up to be on the waitlist for a given role, but be aware that there is no guarantee that you will get that shift at that time. We recommend you consider other open shifts, and if we see you are under the minimum, we will reach out to see where else you may be able to help out. You can also always send us an email with questions to volunteer@bsidessf.org.

# Are all the shift even?

While the shift minimum will put everyone around the same amount of time, we chose to optimize for not having volunteers be on shift when they don't need to be, rather than making all shifts even. Yes, there is a potential to game this system, if it becomes a problem then we will make changes.

# What if there are specific talks I want to go to?

We understand that our volunteers may want to attend specific talks, whether it’s an interesting topic or just to show support for a friend or coworker. Share your preferences with your volunteer lead and we will do our best to accommodate your request.

# Can you provide proof of my volunteer hours?

Absolutely! Reach out to volunteer@bsidessf.org after the conference and we will provide the necessary documentation. Note that you will be responsible for checking in and checking out with BSidesSF Event Volunteer registration to keep your hours accurate.

# Do you work with Benevity, etc. to facilitate donations based on matching volunteer hours?

If your employer offers a [charitable giving program](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1799), they can donate money to BSidesSF based on your volunteer hours. Reach out to your company’s HR team for more information.

BSidesSF is a [registered 501(c)(3) non-profit](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/271830464), so if you like the work we do, we would really appreciate your employer’s donation!

# How do I sign up???

You can sign up for shifts on our new volunteer management page [https://bsidessf2025.volunteerlocal.com](https://bsidessf2025.volunteerlocal.com). Make sure that you've used a valid email and that you've created an account in https://bsidessf.slack.com so that we can contact you. Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/bsidessf/shared_invite/zt-31v5466dx-89P2nThFSdlwIPT0MY1aXg) to sign up if you don't already have an account on Slack.
