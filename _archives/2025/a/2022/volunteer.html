<p>BSidesSF is a security event that would not be possible without the work of our local community. Every year, the organizers work hard to build a fun and exciting agenda so you can experience the latest in cool security happenings. However, we rely on contributions from volunteers like you to help with various tasks on the two days of the event. Join us!</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-it-for-me">What’s in it for me?</h2>

<p>Volunteering is a great way to get involved with the local security community, especially if you are a newcomer. It’s also a good chance to meet other security-minded people while picking up various skills along the way.  All volunteers <strong>must work for a minimum of 6 hours</strong> and will get a free BSidesSF t-shirt + badge (and, if available, food) as part of their volunteer admission. This means you can attend talks during the times that you are not volunteering, using the provided volunteer badge.</p>

<h2 id="what-type-of-volunteers-are-you-looking-for">What type of volunteers are you looking for?</h2>

<p>Anyone and everyone! No two volunteers are alike so we aim to provide opportunities for all personality types and skill sets. Take a look at our role descriptions below for a better idea of which opportunities might be right for you.</p>

<p>At the same time, we realize that not every role will be suitable for every volunteer. For each role, we will mention possible gotchas in order to provide an inclusive experience for all our volunteers. As in previous years, we are adding the following classifications as applicable to our roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roles that require lots of interactions with people</li>
  <li>Roles that may have high noise/sensory effects</li>
  <li>Roles that require mobility</li>
  <li>Roles that may require excessive standing</li>
  <li>Roles that require strength/lifting</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also clearly highlight accessibility features within the venue for those who require it. And as always, we are open to feedback! Please let us know in your request to volunteer or by emailing volunteer@bsidessf.org, and we will work to provide any possible accommodations.</p>

<h2 id="what-tasks-need-to-be-done">What tasks need to be done?</h2>

<p>We group our volunteer opportunities into several pools.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attendee-Facing</strong> - these roles require strong communication skills and a lot of attendee interaction, including General Registration, Information Desk, and Coat Check.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Behind-the-Scenes</strong> - these roles may require higher levels of operational experience and agency, including Registration Bag Stuffing and Floaters. They do not require as much attendee interaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Room Moderators</strong> - these roles require that you are comfortable acting as an MC for event talks/workshops. This means you should be able to communicate clearly for both the speaker’s and the audience’s benefit, and ideally have a strong command of the English language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Safety Ops</strong> - these roles overall will require strong mobility and communication skills.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you sign up for a shift slot, you will pick one of these larger pools and you will work in one or more of the given roles inside that pool depending on volunteer availability and accessibility needs. See the descriptions below for more information about each opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-dont-know-how-to-do-any-of-these">What if I don’t know how to do any of these?</h2>

<p>Our volunteer leads <strong>will train you</strong> for the specific tasks you sign up for, and there will also be volunteer <strong>Q&amp;A sessions prior to the event</strong>. Please try to make time to be available on <strong>Friday, June 3, 2022</strong> at <strong>12PM-1PM</strong> or <strong>6-7PM</strong> for training and Q&amp;A.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-the-shift-i-want-is-filled-up">What if the shift I want is filled up?</h2>

<p>You can sign up to be on the waitlist for a given shift, but be aware that there is no guarantee that you will get that shift at that time. We recommend you consider other open shifts, and if we see you are under the minimum 6 hours, we will reach out to see where else you may be able to help out. You can also always send us an email with questions to volunteer@bsidessf.org.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-there-are-specific-talks-i-want-to-go-to">What if there are specific talks I want to go to?</h2>

<p>We understand that our volunteers may want to attend specific talks, whether it’s an interesting topic or just to show support for a friend or coworker. Share your preferences with your volunteer lead and we will do our best to accommodate your request.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-provide-proof-of-my-volunteer-hours">Can you provide proof of my volunteer hours?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! Reach out to volunteer@bsidessf.org after the conference and we will provide the necessary documentation. Note that you will be responsible for checking in and checking out with BSidesSF Event Volunteer registration to keep your hours accurate.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-work-with-benevity-etc-to-facilitate-donations-based-on-matching-volunteer-hours">Do you work with Benevity, etc. to facilitate donations based on matching volunteer hours?</h2>

<p>If your employer offers a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1799">charitable giving program</a>, they can donate money to BSidesSF based on your volunteer hours. Reach out to your company’s HR team for more information.</p>

<p>BSidesSF is a <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/271830464">registered 501(c)(3) non-profit</a>, so if you like the work we do, we would really appreciate your employer’s donation!</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-other-additional-requirements-this-year">Are there any other additional requirements this year?</h2>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="/about/covid-19-safety-policy">COVID-19 Safety Policy</a> for additional requirements prior to entering the event.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-sign-up">How do I sign up???</h2>

<p>We’re using Timecounts for managing event volunteer shifts this year so you will need to <a href="https://timecounts.org/signup">create a Timecounts account first</a> and <strong>verify your email address</strong> before signing up for any shifts. Then you can sign up directly on the <a href="https://timecounts.org/bsidessf/events/38611">BSidesSF Volunteer Shift Page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-have-further-questions">What if I have further questions?</h2>

<p>Please reach out to volunteer@bsidessf.org, or to <a href="https://bsidessf.slack.com/archives/CNRNRRBS4">#volunteers</a> in Slack and tag @sarah or @jesse.</p>
