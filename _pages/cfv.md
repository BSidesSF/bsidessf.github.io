## Call for Villages

Have a cool idea for a community space at BSidesSF 2026? Why not host a Village?

### What's a Village?

Villages are dedicated spaces at the con arranged around a specific topic or interest; often these are security/privacy or tech related in some way. Participants are able to take part in hands-on activities such as CTFs or labs; they also have the opportunity to network with each other. This is a particularly unique and collaborative way to get more participants actively interested and engaged in a Village's particular niche topic or interest; many times it's an opportunity to bring to light current trends or ongoing research.

As in previous years, we cannot support having talk tracks in the same space as the village itself; villages who want to bring presenters will have to submit through the main **[CFP](/cfp)** process, which closes in late October.

### We offer

* Dedicated space: Host your Village or community organization in the center of BSidesSF Participation Hall, at City View at Metreon in downtown San Francisco.
* Supportive infrastructure: In addition to tables and chairs, we provide an optional monitor and high-speed wifi.
* Partial financial assistance: We recognize that putting together a village can be costly! Limited travel support for Village leaders may be available. Contact us for more information. We also strongly encourage Villages to seek their own sponsorships.

### Theme

Security is more than just automation, LLMs and threat modeling â€”itâ€™s a dynamic performance where practitioners are vital members of the cast. Like a thrilling new production, the security landscape is filled with dramatic twists, unexpected harmonies, and the occasional improvisation.

As the curtain rises on our 2026 conference, weâ€™re calling all security maestros, backstage wizards, and ensemble cast members to share your stories. Have you orchestrated defenses against evolving threats? Choreographed responses to unpredictable incidents? Written a new score for collaboration or innovation? Whether youâ€™re part of the ensemble, band, or soloist, we want to hear your experiences, lessons, and creative solutions.

Come help us compose the next act in securityâ€”take a bow, share your unique verse, and join the chorus of voices shaping the future. The spotlight is yours! ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶
