    </h2>

    <h3>We can't wait to share the Next Big Thing!</h3>

    <p>
      Call for Participation is closed! Thanks to all who submitted.
      We received a total of 334 reviewable submissions (up 59.8% from 209 in 2023), but could only accept 60.
      This means we had an unusually low acceptance rate of 17.9% (compared to 28.7% in 2023).
      We will be reviewing ways to improve the CFP process and acceptance rate for 2025+. Stay tuned!
