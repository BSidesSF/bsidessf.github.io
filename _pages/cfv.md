### Theme

This year, we dive into uncharted territory of security under the theme "Here
Be Dragons." Like the ancient maps that marked unknown regions with dragons,
today's landscape is filled with threats that are complex, evolving, and often
unpredictable. As security practitioners, we are the navigators of this vast,
sometimes dangerous terrain. We're opening the call to participate in our 2025
conference - come share your experiences exploring new challenges, discovering
the unknown, battling cutting-edge technologies, and sharing strategies to
confront the 'dragons' lurking in the shadows.
