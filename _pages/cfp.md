BSidesSF 2024 CFP is Closed! Thanks to all who submitted.

We received a total of 334 reviewable submissions (up 59.8% from 209 in 2023), but could only accept 60. This means we had an unusually low acceptance rate of 17.9% (compared to 28.7% in 2023), despite 45% of the submissions receiving favorable reviews.

We expect to open the BSidesSF 2025 CFP by October 2024 (with an expected deadline of January 2025). Stay tuned!

# **Interested in participating on the BSidesSF 2025 Program Committee?**

We're always looking for folks to help us shape BSidesSF content! CFP reviewers typically spend 30-40 hours (if not more) around the Dec 2024/Jan 2025 timeframe. We also typically ask reviewers for recommendations for new keynote speakers. You will receive free admission to BSidesSF at the end for all your hard work.
