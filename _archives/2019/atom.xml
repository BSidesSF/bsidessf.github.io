<p><strong>Getting to the Event</strong></p>

<p>We are back once again at the Metreon located at 135 4th Street in downtown San Francisco. The location of the Metreon lends itself to a few different transportation options. For those looking to take BART, the Metreon is located only a couple of blocks from the Powell Street station. For those interested in taking Caltrain, the Metreon is one mile from the King Street station. For those driving, the Fifth and Mission Parking Garage is located directly across Fourth Street and offers 24-hour parking.</p>

<p>The Metreon will be closed to the general public until 10:30am both Sunday and Monday, so you will need to enter through the Yerba Buena Gardens entrance located most closely to Mission Street. Once you are inside of the Metreon, take the stairs, escalators, or elevator up to the Mezzanine level for registration. The event will be distributed throughout the AMC Metreon 16 located on the third floor and the City View event space located on the fourth floor, but you must first register on the Mezzanine to have access to these areas. To expedite registration, please have your QR code ready.</p>

<p>If you pre-purchased a t-shirt, these can be picked up on the fourth floor beginning at 12:15pm on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Before You Attend</strong></p>

<p>Before you attend the event, we ask that you review our <a href="https://bsidessf.org/about/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>  as well as our <a href="https://bsidessf.org/about/photo-policy.html">Photo and Video Policies</a>. We require that all guests show respect and tolerance for each other’s uniqueness. We have no tolerance for physical, verbal, or sexual harassment; intimidation; or marginalization of any human!</p>

<p><strong>Two Full Days of Talks, Events, and Happenings</strong></p>

<p>The full schedule of events can be found on <a href="https://bsidessf2019.sched.com/">Sched</a>. All talks, villages, and the CTF are open to any and all conference participants; if there is an open seat, it’s yours. The Living Security Escape Room runs multiple times each day, and registration is necessary as only eight individuals can participate at one time. Registration is available on-site, but times may fill-up quickly so <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsidessf-security-escape-room-presented-by-living-security-tickets-56370646120">pre-registration</a>  is recommended.</p>

<p>We encourage all participants to take a stroll through the Sponsor Lounge, which will include representatives from some of the organizations that made this year’s event possible. Many of our sponsors are actively recruiting, so we encourage you to stop by their booths to learn more if you are interested in new opportunities. We’d like to bring special attention to these sponsors who have called out recruiting as a key reason for their sponsorship: <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/careers/">HackerOne</a>, <a href="https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Cmd-923823e9/about">Cmd</a>, <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.oath.com/careers/work-at-oath/">Verizon Media</a> , <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://stripe.com/jobs">Stripe</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We had the largest number of submissions ever – 147 to be exact</li>
  <li>We are moving to a new location (City View at Metreon), only a short walk from RSA Conference!</li>
  <li>Our CFP review team was bigger and more diverse than ever</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not sure if we have ever given insight into our CFP process, but I feel like this year we should. I’d also like to provide an explanation for the errors from last night.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>Our CFP review is a blind review where the review committee has access to the title, abstract summary, and detailed outline. Reviewers issue a score between 1-5 for each submission, which is then fed into the master list and averaged out to determine which talk is accepted or not. We attempt to remove bias introduced by individual reviewers with some additional math. We add fractional points (via a multiplier) if the presenter has never spoken at BSidesSF before, and deduct fractional points if anyone on the review team feels the talk directly promotes a vendor’s product.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>This year we are at a new and much larger location and are adding a third track, which means we can have more presenters! We accepted 47 talks this year, asked a few to be on standby in case a presenter doesn’t make the conference, and unfortunately had to pass on nearly 100 other submissions.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>It’s always difficult letting individuals know that their talk was not accepted, especially when we see the names. Sometimes that even means telling some close friends and colleagues that they won’t be presenting this year at your conference. This year was especially hard in that we had many really good talks that were just on the edge of being accepted.</p>

<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>Last night when we were sending out the acceptance, standby, and rejection notices, I made a mistake when executing the notification script and forgot to replace the email template used to the not-accepted template. This led to sending acceptance emails to the list of submissions that we were unable to accept this year due to volume and quality of submissions. The error was found within minutes and a correction email sent out. It was messy, and there is no excuse. I feel terrible for the confusion and possible pain I caused to those that received an initial acceptance email to then be told minutes later that they will not be presenting this year. We’re going to be making changes to our process for future years to prevent such incidents.</p>

<p>We appreciate the community support and understanding through this mistake and are looking forward to the best BSidesSF yet! The BSidesSF conference is 100% volunteer run by people that love the local security community. For those we accepted in error, we deeply regret our mistake, and you will be hearing from us again shortly. We hope to see everyone in April!</p>
