efforts, we could not determine how to meaningfully replicate community in a virtual event.</p>

<p>In its place, we’ll be replaying a selection of the best talks from our past events and pairing these
talks with live Q&amp;A and a virtual CTF. While we realize this isn’t a replacement for our annual event,
we hope you’ll continue to support BSidesSF in 2021 and beyond. Please know this is in no way the end
of BSidesSF. We plan to be back with a live event in 2022.</p>

<p>For prospective sponsors, we will have a small number of sponsorship opportunities available. Reach
out to sponsors [at] bsidessf.org to get notified once our sponsorship kit has been released.</p>

We want to ensure everybody’s participation is amazing, so please read below for important information concerning this year’s event.</p>

<h3 id="getting-to-the-event">Getting to the Event</h3>

<p>We are back once again at the Metreon located at 135 4th Street in downtown San Francisco. The location of the Metreon lends itself to a few different transportation options. For those looking to take BART or Muni, the Metreon is located about a block from the Powell Street station. For those interested in taking Caltrain, the Metreon is one mile from the King Street station. For those driving, the Fifth and Mission Parking Garage is located directly across 4th Street and offers 24-hour parking.</p>

<p>Once you are inside of the Metreon, take the stairs, escalators, or elevator up to the Mezzanine level for registration. The event will be distributed throughout the AMC Metreon 16 located on the third floor and the City View event space located on the fourth floor. However, you must first register on the Mezzanine to have access to these areas. To expedite registration, please have your QR code ready.</p>

<p>If you pre-purchased a t-shirt, these can be picked up on the fourth floor (City View) at Coat Check beginning at 11:00am on Sunday.</p>

<h3 id="before-you-attend">Before You Attend</h3>

<p>Before you attend the event, we ask that you review our <a href="https://bsidessf.org/about/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>
as well as our <a href="https://bsidessf.org/about/photo-policy.html">Photo and Video Policies</a>. We require that all guests
abide by our policies and show respect and tolerance for each other’s uniqueness. We have no tolerance for physical,
verbal, or sexual harassment; intimidation; or marginalization of any human! Additionally, due to venue restrictions,
please note we only allow service animals at the event and will not be able to store bikes or scooters within the venue.</p>

<h3 id="two-full-days-of-talks-events-and-happenings">Two Full Days of Talks, Events, and Happenings</h3>

<p>Doors will open at 9am and talks begin at 10am. The full schedule of events can be found on
<a href="https://bsidessf2020.sched.com/">Sched</a> and HackerTracker (on Android and iOS). All talks, villages,
and the CTF are open to any and all participants; if there is an open seat, it’s yours. For questions
during talks, we will be using <a href="slido.com">Slido</a> with code #BSidesSF2020.</p>

<p>We encourage all participants to take a stroll through the Participant Hall and visit all our sponsors, without
whom this event would not be possible. Many of our sponsors are actively recruiting, so we encourage you to stop
by their booths to learn more if you are interested in new opportunities. We’ll be raffling off some really awesome
items, so make sure to get your Sponsor Passport stamped and turned in prior to the daily raffle.</p>

<h3 id="novel-coronavirus-covid-19">Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation in partnership with the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
We take the risk to our community very seriously and want to make sure we are protecting our participants (you!) as best
we can. SFDPH’s current guidance is to continue business as usual and they do not recommend that any events be canceled.
However, we are taking several precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All registration bags include hand sanitizer courtesy of one of our sponsors – please use it!</li>
  <li>All bathrooms and most major areas contain hand sanitizer available for use.</li>
  <li>We ask that you practice “Respiratory Hygiene” / “Cough Etiquette” – cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze; avoid touching your hands, nose, and mouth to avoid transferring germs from surfaces; discard any used tissue immediately into a trash can; and wash your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer and/or soap and water right away.</li>
  <li>All major surfaces will be regularly sanitized throughout the event, including presenter microphones between uses.</li>
  <li>If you feel sick, are experiencing any cold/flu-like symptoms or have traveled to a COVID-19 affected region within the past two weeks, for your own safety and the safety of everyone else please stay home, rest up, and get well. We’ll post the talk recordings online in a few weeks. Reply to this email, and we will be happy to provide you a refund.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-event">The Event</h2>

<p>This year, I had the privilege to lead the team for the BSides San Francisco
CTF.  We had 1112 active players on 676 teams over the 32 hour CTF.
Collectively, 2740 flags were submitted to 41 of our 43 challenges.  So far, the
<a href="https://ctftime.org/event/753/weight/">CTFTime ratings</a> have been excellent,
and I hope we’ll be able to do that again.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, I want to give kudos to my entire team:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/iagox86">iagox86</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/itsC0rg1">c0rg1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/bmenrigh">symmetric</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/cornflakesavage">bryane</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/exploitexercise">exploitexercise</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This would not have been possible without all their efforts.  I also want to
give a special shoutout to Puneet, who handled all the physical logistics for us
so we could focus on building the CTF.  I also want to thank the BSidesSF staff
and volunteers for giving us the space and opportunity to do this.  Also thanks
to the bar staff for keeping us “hydrated!”</p>

<h2 id="the-infrastructure">The Infrastructure</h2>

<p>(Full disclosure: I’m a member of the Google Information Security Team.)</p>

<p>We were running <a href="https://github.com/google/ctfscoreboard">the scoreboard</a> I
originally wrote for the Google CTF (though it’s no longer used for that
purpose), hosted on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a>.  I
love hosting apps on a runtime like that – the scaling and replication is just
magic, so we didn’t have the typical latency spike a lot of CTFs do at the very
beginning.  95th percentile latency remained under 500ms, which is a result I’m
very happy with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ctf_2019/sb_traffic.png" alt="Traffic" /></p>

<p>All of the online challenges were run on Kubernetes on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud
Platform</a> (for the 3rd year straight).
We continue to love this option, because we run Docker locally for building &amp;
testing challenges, then transform these images straight to Kubernetes.
Additionally, Kubernetes provides capabilities like load balancing that allow us
to scale challenges up when some people feel the need to try to brute force.</p>

<p>This year, for the first time, we attempted to use Network Policies to prevent
access to the GCP metadata API, which worked, until I inadvertently deleted the
policies while debugging an issue with another challenge.  Fortunately, I don’t
believe this was exploited during the CTF, but I did notice some exploitation
attempts after the game.</p>

<p>Another first for this year was the use of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ingress</code> for all of our HTTP
services.  We used a wildcard certificate from Let’s Encrypt and then performed
distribution to backends based on the hostname provided by the client.  This
allowed us to use a single external IP, easily provide HTTPS for the challenges,
and also provided load balancing for the challenges.</p>

<p>All of this infrastructure comes with some difficulties compared to just
spinning up a bunch of VMs.  First off, there’s layers of complexity, like the
load balancers and the pods that contain containers.  There’s multiple backends,
so if only one is acting up, it’s harder to debug.  Additionally, for anything
with load balancing, it either needs to be stateless, or you need a way to sync
the state.  (IP load balancing might work, except we had a large portion of our
players coming from the one IP on site.)</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> was nice enough to give us credits to
run all of our infrastructure, so big thanks to them for making this possible
for over 1100 players.  Questions about how we ran this?  Reach out to me on
<a href="https://twitter.com/matir">Twitter</a> or see my follow-up
<a href="https://systemoverlord.com">blog posts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>Rather than trying to describe the challenges, I’d rather just point to our
public <a href="https://github.com/bsidessf/ctf-2019-release">release of our source
code</a>.  Check out the challenges
and keep in mind that (as of writing) we’re still running the services and the
<a href="https://ctf.bsidessf.net">scoreboard</a>.  Give them a shot and now you can see
how the source and actual service interact.</p>

<h2 id="winners">Winners</h2>

<p>Congratulations to our 3 winners:</p>

<ol>
  <li>dcua (2nd year running)</li>
  <li>perfect blue</li>
  <li>OpenToAll</li>
</ol>

<p>I also want to congratulate every team that played.  If you learned something or
had a good time (preferrably both), then we did our jobs correctly.</p>

<h2 id="writeups">Writeups</h2>

<p>There have been a number of challenge writeups appearing, including author
writeups:</p>

<p><strong>Getting to the Event</strong></p>

<p>We are back once again at the Metreon located at 135 4th Street in downtown San Francisco. The location of the Metreon lends itself to a few different transportation options. For those looking to take BART, the Metreon is located only a couple of blocks from the Powell Street station. For those interested in taking Caltrain, the Metreon is one mile from the King Street station. For those driving, the Fifth and Mission Parking Garage is located directly across Fourth Street and offers 24-hour parking.</p>

<p>The Metreon will be closed to the general public until 10:30am both Sunday and Monday, so you will need to enter through the Yerba Buena Gardens entrance located most closely to Mission Street. Once you are inside of the Metreon, take the stairs, escalators, or elevator up to the Mezzanine level for registration. The event will be distributed throughout the AMC Metreon 16 located on the third floor and the City View event space located on the fourth floor, but you must first register on the Mezzanine to have access to these areas. To expedite registration, please have your QR code ready.</p>

<p>If you pre-purchased a t-shirt, these can be picked up on the fourth floor beginning at 12:15pm on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Before You Attend</strong></p>

<p>Before you attend the event, we ask that you review our <a href="https://bsidessf.org/about/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>  as well as our <a href="https://bsidessf.org/about/photo-policy.html">Photo and Video Policies</a>. We require that all guests show respect and tolerance for each other’s uniqueness. We have no tolerance for physical, verbal, or sexual harassment; intimidation; or marginalization of any human!</p>

<p><strong>Two Full Days of Talks, Events, and Happenings</strong></p>

<p>The full schedule of events can be found on <a href="https://bsidessf2019.sched.com/">Sched</a>. All talks, villages, and the CTF are open to any and all conference participants; if there is an open seat, it’s yours. The Living Security Escape Room runs multiple times each day, and registration is necessary as only eight individuals can participate at one time. Registration is available on-site, but times may fill-up quickly so <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsidessf-security-escape-room-presented-by-living-security-tickets-56370646120">pre-registration</a>  is recommended.</p>

<p>We encourage all participants to take a stroll through the Sponsor Lounge, which will include representatives from some of the organizations that made this year’s event possible. Many of our sponsors are actively recruiting, so we encourage you to stop by their booths to learn more if you are interested in new opportunities. We’d like to bring special attention to these sponsors who have called out recruiting as a key reason for their sponsorship: <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/careers/">HackerOne</a>, <a href="https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Cmd-923823e9/about">Cmd</a>, <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.oath.com/careers/work-at-oath/">Verizon Media</a> , <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://stripe.com/jobs">Stripe</a>.</p>
