Ensure you have permission from anyone you photograph or record. This includes those in the
background of your shot. “Crowd shots” from the front (facing the crowd) are strongly discouraged.
If you’ve accidentally taken a photo or video without permission, delete it. If you are asked by a
participant to delete/blur a photo or video they did not give you permission to take, do so immediately.
