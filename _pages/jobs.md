# Come help us plan the next BSidesSF!

We're looking for a Few Good Humans to help us present the Next Big Thing.

BSidesSF is a 100% volunteer-run organization. All roles are volunteer-based with no pay.

Volunteering is a good way to show your enthusiasm and ability to work with the group, especially if you can
help with setup, teardown, and different tasks througout the event. All organizers work from the start of 
setup through the end of teardown.
